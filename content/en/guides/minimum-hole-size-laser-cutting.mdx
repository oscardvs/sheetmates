# Minimum Hole Size for Laser Cutting

One of the most common laser cutting design mistakes is creating holes that are too small to cut reliably. Understanding minimum feature sizes prevents wasted time, failed cuts, and rejected parts.

## The Golden Rule

**Minimum hole diameter = Material thickness**

This simple rule prevents 90% of hole-related problems.

**Examples:**
- 1mm steel → 1mm minimum hole
- 3mm aluminum → 3mm minimum hole
- 6mm stainless → 6mm minimum hole

## Why Minimum Sizes Matter

### Physical Limitations

The laser beam has a finite width (kerf):
- Typical kerf: 0.1mm - 0.4mm depending on material
- Beam focus depth: Limited penetration
- Heat-affected zone: Spreads beyond cut line

**What happens with too-small holes:**
1. **Incomplete cuts** - Beam can't penetrate fully
2. **Heat warping** - Excessive heat distorts metal
3. **Dross buildup** - Melted material clogs small holes
4. **Poor edge quality** - Rough, burnt edges
5. **Part rejection** - Holes don't meet specifications

### Material Physics

Thicker material requires:
- More laser power
- Longer dwell time
- Wider kerf
- Larger heat-affected zone

**Result:** Thicker material → Larger minimum feature size

## Minimum Hole Size by Material

### Steel (Mild/Carbon Steel)

| Thickness | Min Hole Diameter | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| 0.5mm | 0.5mm | Very small, use caution |
| 1mm | 1mm | Standard minimum |
| 2mm | 2mm | Common for brackets |
| 3mm | 3mm | M3 bolt clearance |
| 5mm | 5mm | Structural parts |
| 10mm | 10mm | Heavy duty |

**Best practices:**
- Add 0.5mm margin for reliability
- 1.5mm holes in 1mm material = safer than 1mm holes

### Aluminum

| Thickness | Min Hole Diameter | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| 1mm | 1.5mm | Aluminum needs larger |
| 2mm | 2.5mm | Higher thermal conductivity |
| 3mm | 4mm | Wide kerf |
| 6mm | 7mm | Significant heat spread |

**Why larger?**
- High thermal conductivity spreads heat
- Reflective surface needs more power
- Wider kerf than steel

### Stainless Steel

| Thickness | Min Hole Diameter | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| 1mm | 1mm | Similar to mild steel |
| 2mm | 2mm | Standard |
| 3mm | 3mm | Excellent cut quality |
| 5mm | 5mm | Food-grade applications |

**Characteristics:**
- Similar to mild steel
- Slightly harder to cut
- Excellent edge finish

### Copper

| Thickness | Min Hole Diameter | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| 1mm | 2mm | Highly reflective |
| 2mm | 3mm | Difficult to cut |
| 3mm | 5mm | Wide kerf required |

**Challenges:**
- Extremely reflective
- High thermal conductivity
- Limited thickness range (max ~6mm)

## Minimum Wall Thickness

Not just holes—thin walls have limits too.

**Rule:** Minimum wall thickness = Material thickness

**Why?**
- Thin walls warp from heat
- Risk breaking during handling
- Poor structural integrity

**Example:**
```
3mm steel:
✅ 3mm+ wall thickness
❌ 1mm wall thickness (will warp/break)
```

## Aspect Ratio Concerns

Beyond minimum size, consider hole depth-to-diameter ratio.

**Aspect ratio = Thickness / Hole Diameter**

**Safe ratios:**
- Ratio < 1:1 → Excellent (3mm hole in 3mm material)
- Ratio 1:1 to 2:1 → Good (3mm hole in 6mm material)
- Ratio > 2:1 → Problematic (3mm hole in 10mm material)

**High aspect ratios cause:**
- Incomplete penetration
- Tapered holes (wider at top)
- Excessive dross
- Poor perpendicularity

## Design Solutions for Small Features

### Need a hole smaller than minimum?

**Option 1: Drill after cutting**
- Laser cut a pilot hole (min size)
- Drill to final diameter
- Best for precision holes

**Option 2: Use thinner material**
- 0.5mm steel allows 0.5mm holes
- Check if thinner material meets strength requirements

**Option 3: Redesign**
- Slot instead of round hole?
- Multiple larger holes instead of one small?
- Eliminate the feature entirely?

### Slots and Oblong Holes

**Minimum width** = Material thickness
**Minimum length** = Any length ≥ width
**Corner radius** = Minimum 0.5mm (kerf width)

**Example:**
3mm steel:
- Slot width: ≥ 3mm
- Slot length: Any
- End radius: ≥ 0.5mm

## Testing Minimum Sizes

Want to verify limits for your specific setup?

**Test Pattern Method:**

Create a test piece with graduated hole sizes:
```
1mm, 1.5mm, 2mm, 2.5mm, 3mm, 3.5mm, 4mm, 5mm
```

**Cut and inspect:**
- Which holes cut cleanly?
- Where does quality degrade?
- Where do holes fail completely?

**Document results:**
- Material type
- Thickness
- Smallest reliable hole size
- Use for future designs

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Copying PCB Designs

**Problem:** PCB drill sizes (0.3mm - 0.8mm) won't work in sheet metal

**Example:**
- PCB: 0.6mm hole → Fine
- 1mm steel: 0.6mm hole → Won't cut

**Solution:** Scale up features or use thinner material

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Tolerance Stack-up

**Problem:** Holes near minimum size + tolerance = undersized holes

**Example:**
- Design: 3mm hole in 3mm steel
- Tolerance: ±0.2mm
- Result: 2.8mm hole (too small!)

**Solution:** Add 0.5mm safety margin to minimum sizes

### Mistake #3: Blind Faith in CAD

**Problem:** CAD allows any size feature

**Reality:** Physical limits don't care about your CAD model

**Solution:** Apply design rules **before** finalizing design

### Mistake #4: Assuming All Materials Are Equal

**Problem:** Using steel rules for aluminum

**Reality:** Each material has different minimums

**Solution:** Check material-specific tables above

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: M3 Bolt Holes

**Requirement:** M3 bolt (3mm thread)
**Clearance fit:** 3.5mm hole
**Material:** 3mm steel

**Analysis:**
- Min hole for 3mm steel: 3mm
- Desired hole: 3.5mm
- ✅ 3.5mm > 3mm → Safe

### Example 2: Ventilation Grille

**Requirement:** Maximum airflow
**Material:** 2mm aluminum
**Min hole:** 2.5mm (aluminum + margin)

**Design options:**
```
Option A: 100× 3mm holes (safe)
Option B: 200× 2mm holes (risky—below minimum)
Option C: 50× 5mm holes (safe, less airflow)
```

**Best:** Option A balances safety and airflow

### Example 3: Mounting Tab

**Requirement:** Slot for adjustment
**Material:** 1mm steel

**Design:**
- Slot width: 5mm (for M4 bolt)
- Slot length: 20mm
- Min width: 1mm → ✅ 5mm safe

## DFM Checker: Minimum Size Violations

SheetMates automatically flags undersized features:

**Auto-detection:**
- ⚠️ Hole < material thickness
- ⚠️ Wall < material thickness
- ⚠️ Aspect ratio > 2:1
- ⚠️ Corner radius < 0.5mm

**Before you order:** Fix all warnings for best results

## Advanced: Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ)

The area around the cut that's affected by heat:

**HAZ width:**
- Steel: ~0.2mm - 0.5mm
- Aluminum: ~0.5mm - 1mm (high conductivity)
- Stainless: ~0.2mm - 0.4mm

**Impact on small holes:**
- Holes near minimum size have proportionally larger HAZ
- May affect fit tolerance
- Can cause discoloration

**Mitigation:**
- Increase hole size beyond minimum
- Use assist gas (oxygen/nitrogen)
- Post-process heat treatment (rarely needed)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I cut 0.5mm holes in 1mm steel?**
A: No. Minimum hole = material thickness. Use 0.5mm material or drill after cutting.

**Q: Why does my manufacturer have different minimums?**
A: Different laser power, focus, and assist gas affect capabilities. Always check with your specific vendor.

**Q: What about countersunk holes?**
A: Laser cutting is 2D only. Countersinks require post-processing (drilling, milling).

**Q: Can I make square holes?**
A: Yes, but internal corners need ≥0.5mm radius (kerf width). True square corners are impossible with laser cutting.

**Q: Do thicker materials allow smaller holes eventually?**
A: No—opposite! Thicker material requires larger minimum holes.

## Summary

**Remember these 3 rules:**

1. **Minimum hole diameter = Material thickness**
2. **Minimum wall thickness = Material thickness**
3. **Add 0.5mm safety margin for reliability**

**Material-specific adjustments:**
- Aluminum: +50% larger minimum
