# Complete Guide to DXF Laser Cutting

If you're new to laser cutting or frustrated by files that don't cut correctly, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know about preparing DXF files for laser cutting.

## What is DXF and Why Does It Matter?

**DXF (Drawing Exchange Format)** is the universal file format for laser cutting. Created by Autodesk in 1982, DXF files contain vector geometry that tells the laser cutter exactly where to cut.

**Why DXF?**
- **Universal compatibility**: Works with all CAD software and laser cutting machines
- **Vector-based**: Contains precise geometric data, not pixels
- **Lightweight**: Small file sizes even for complex designs
- **Machine-readable**: CNC machines can directly interpret cutting paths

## Supported DXF Versions

Not all DXF files are created equal. Here's what works:

**✅ Recommended Versions:**
- DXF R12/R13 (ASCII) - Most compatible
- DXF R14 (AutoCAD 2000)
- DXF 2004/2007 - Modern standard

**❌ Avoid:**
- Binary DXF files (use ASCII)
- DXF versions newer than 2013 (compatibility issues)
- Proprietary formats (.dwg, .ai, .svg) without conversion

**Pro tip**: When exporting from CAD software, always choose "DXF R12 ASCII" for maximum compatibility.

## Essential Design Rules for Laser Cutting

### Rule #1: Closed Contours Only

Laser cutters require **closed shapes** to know where to cut completely through the material.

**❌ Common mistakes:**
- Open paths (lines that don't connect)
- Gaps in corners
- Overlapping lines
- Double lines (offset paths)

**✅ Fix it:**
- Use "Join" or "Weld" commands in your CAD software
- Check for gaps < 0.01mm (zoom in!)
- Remove duplicate entities
- Ensure all shapes are fully closed loops

### Rule #2: Minimum Feature Sizes

Every material/thickness combination has physical limits:

| Material | Thickness | Min Hole Diameter | Min Wall Thickness |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Steel | 1mm | 1mm | 1mm |
| Steel | 3mm | 3mm | 3mm |
| Aluminum | 2mm | 2mm | 2mm |
| Stainless | 3mm | 3mm | 3mm |

**Why?** Laser beams have width (kerf). Features smaller than the material thickness risk:
- Not cutting through
- Heat warping
- Breakage during handling
- Poor edge quality

**Rule of thumb**: Minimum hole diameter = material thickness. Minimum wall thickness = material thickness.

### Rule #3: Corner Radius

Sharp internal corners create stress concentration points.

**Problem**: Corners < 0.5mm radius can cause:
- Cracking during bending
- Stress fractures
- Material failure at corners

**Solution**: Add fillets (rounded corners) of at least 0.5mm radius to all internal corners.

**External corners** can be sharp, but internal corners need radius.

### Rule #4: Heat Warp Prevention

Long, thin features are susceptible to heat distortion during cutting.

**Warning signs:**
- Length / Width > 10
- Width < Thickness × 2

**Example**: 100mm long, 2mm wide piece in 3mm material = warp risk

**Solutions:**
- Add temporary tabs/bridges
- Reduce length-to-width ratio
- Increase feature width
- Cut from thinner material

## Understanding Kerf and Compensation

**Kerf** is the width of material removed by the laser beam (typically 0.1mm to 0.3mm).

### Why Kerf Matters

When the laser cuts:
- **Internal holes**: Get larger (material removed from inside)
- **External parts**: Get smaller (material removed from outside)

**Example**: Design a 10mm diameter hole:
- With 0.2mm kerf → Actual hole = 10.2mm diameter

### When to Compensate

**Compensate for kerf when:**
- Tight tolerances required (< ±0.5mm)
- Press-fit assemblies
- Mechanical parts with mating features
- Precision jigs and fixtures

**Don't compensate when:**
- General fabrication (tolerance > 1mm)
- Decorative parts
- Prototypes (first iteration)
- Using SheetMates (we handle it automatically)

### How to Compensate

**Method 1: Offset Paths (Recommended)**
1. Draw part at nominal size
2. Offset internal features outward by kerf/2
3. Offset external boundaries inward by kerf/2

**Method 2: Adjust Dimensions**
- Internal holes: Reduce diameter by kerf width
- External parts: Increase dimensions by kerf width

**In CAD software:**
- **Fusion 360**: Use "Offset" command with Manufacturing→CAM→Kerf compensation
- **SolidWorks**: Sheet Metal→Laser/Plasma→Kerf width
- **AutoCAD**: OFFSET command (manual)

## Material Considerations

Different materials behave differently under laser cutting.

### Steel (Mild Steel)

**Properties:**
- Excellent cut quality
- Minimal heat-affected zone
- Cost-effective
- Wide thickness range (0.5mm - 20mm)

**DXF tips:**
- Works well with standard designs
- No special considerations needed
- High kerf consistency (±0.02mm)

### Aluminum

**Properties:**
- Highly reflective (requires more power)
- Prone to dross (melted material on underside)
- Excellent thermal conductivity

**DXF tips:**
- Increase corner radius to 1mm minimum
- Avoid very thin walls (< 2× thickness)
- Expect slightly larger kerf (~0.3mm)

### Stainless Steel

**Properties:**
- Corrosion resistant
- Harder than mild steel
- Premium finish quality
- Food-grade options available

**DXF tips:**
- Similar to mild steel
- May require reduced cutting speed (not your concern)
- Excellent edge quality

### Copper

**Properties:**
- Extremely reflective
- Excellent conductor
- Limited thickness range (0.5mm - 10mm)

**DXF tips:**
- Maximum thickness usually 6mm
- Wider kerf (~0.4mm)
- Avoid small details in thick copper

## Common DXF Problems and Fixes

### Problem: "File Can't Be Read"

**Causes:**
- Corrupt file
- Unsupported DXF version
- Binary format instead of ASCII

**Solutions:**
1. Re-export as DXF R12 ASCII
2. Open in LibreCAD and re-save
3. Check file isn't corrupted (try opening in multiple programs)

### Problem: "Parts Too Small"

**Cause**: Features smaller than material thickness

**Solution:**
- Check minimum feature table above
- Scale up small features
- Split into multiple parts
- Use thinner material

### Problem: "Open Contours Detected"

**Cause**: Paths aren't fully closed

**Solution:**
1. Visual inspection: Zoom in 500%+
2. Use "Join" tool with tolerance 0.01mm
3. Delete duplicate lines
4. Check layer structure (all on one layer)

### Problem: "Excessive Nested Shapes"

**Cause**: Shape within shape within shape (Russian doll effect)

**Solution:**
- Remove internal duplicates
- Flatten layers
- Explode blocks/groups
- Keep only outer cut paths

## File Organization Best Practices

### Layer Management

**Keep it simple:**
- Use **one layer** for cut paths
- Name it "CUT" or "CUTTING"
- Delete all other layers (construction, dimensions, text)

**Why?** Multiple layers cause confusion about what to cut.

### Units and Scale

**Always specify units:**
- Millimeters (mm) - Standard in Europe
- Inches (in) - Common in US

**Check scale:**
- 1:1 scale (actual size)
- No scaling factors
- Real-world dimensions

**Verification**: A 100mm square should measure exactly 100mm in your DXF viewer.

### Text and Annotations

**Remove before export:**
- Dimensions
- Notes
- Labels
- Text (unless you want it cut/engraved)

**Why?** Text is usually cosmetic, not cut paths.

## Advanced Topics

### Nesting Optimization

**What is nesting?** Arranging multiple parts on a single sheet to minimize waste.

**SheetMates handles this automatically**, but understanding helps:

**Good nesting:**
- Parts close together (2-5mm gap)
- Efficient use of sheet corners
- Mixed part sizes for density

**Poor nesting:**
- Large gaps between parts
- Wasted sheet edges
- Single orientation only

### Kerf Bending

**Technique**: Adding cut patterns to allow bending of flat sheets.

**DXF requirements:**
- Precise kerf spacing (0.5mm - 2mm gaps)
- Consistent pattern depth
- Leave uncut "living hinge" strip

**Use cases:**
- Curved surfaces
- Organic shapes
- Packaging

**Not covered in detail here** - advanced technique.

### Multi-Sheet Projects

**Handling multiple parts:**

**Option 1: Single DXF**
- All parts in one file
- We nest automatically
- Most cost-effective

**Option 2: Multiple DXFs**
- Separate files per part
- Upload individually
- Good for different materials/thicknesses

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use SVG files instead of DXF?**
A: SVG can work but requires conversion. DXF is native to CAD and CNC machines. Use online converters with caution - they may introduce errors.

**Q: How accurate is laser cutting?**
A: Typical tolerance is ±0.1mm. For tighter tolerances (±0.05mm), specify when ordering.

**Q: Do I need kerf compensation for prototypes?**
A: Usually not for first prototypes. Test fit, then adjust if needed for production.

**Q: Can I cut text?**
A: Yes, but minimum letter height should be 10mm for 1-2mm material. Smaller text may close up or break.

**Q: What if my CAD software doesn't export DXF?**
A: Most do. Check File → Export → DXF. Alternatives: PDF → DXF converters, or contact us for help.

## Summary

Preparing DXF files for laser cutting is straightforward once you understand the rules:

1. **Use DXF R12 ASCII format**
2. **Follow minimum feature sizes** (diameter and wall = thickness)
3. **Close all contours** (no open paths)
4. **Add corner radii** (≥ 0.5mm internal)
