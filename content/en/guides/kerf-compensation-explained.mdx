# Kerf Compensation in Laser Cutting Explained

If you've ever laser cut a part and found the holes are slightly bigger than designed, or your parts are a hair smaller than expected, you've encountered **kerf**.

## What is Kerf?

**Kerf** is the width of material removed by the laser beam during cutting. Think of it as the "saw blade thickness" of laser cutting.

**Typical kerf widths:**
- Fiber lasers: 0.1mm - 0.2mm
- CO2 lasers: 0.2mm - 0.4mm
- Varies by material thickness and type

**Why it happens:**
The laser beam has a finite width (typically 0.1mm - 0.3mm diameter). When it cuts through material, it vaporizes a thin strip, creating the kerf.

## How Kerf Affects Your Parts

### Internal Features (Holes)

When cutting a hole:
- Laser removes material from **inside** the hole
- **Result:** Hole diameter **increases** by the kerf width

**Example:**
- Design: 10.0mm diameter hole
- Kerf: 0.2mm
- Actual result: 10.2mm diameter hole

**Visual:**
```
Designed hole: ●---10.0mm---●
After cutting:  ○--10.2mm--○
               ^ Laser removed material from inside
```

### External Features (Parts)

When cutting the outer perimeter:
- Laser removes material from **outside** the part
- **Result:** Part dimensions **decrease** by the kerf width

**Example:**
- Design: 50.0mm square
- Kerf: 0.2mm
- Actual result: 49.8mm square

## When to Compensate for Kerf

### ✅ Compensate When:

**1. Tight Tolerances Required**
- Tolerance: ±0.2mm or tighter
- Press-fit assemblies
- Bearing seats
- Precision jigs

**2. Mating Parts**
- Tab-and-slot joints
- Interlocking pieces
- Mechanical assemblies
- Multi-part assemblies

**3. High-Volume Production**
- Consistent part dimensions critical
- Quality control requirements
- Customer specifications

### ❌ Don't Compensate When:

**1. General Fabrication**
- Tolerance: ±1mm or looser
- Cosmetic parts
- Enclosures with clearance
- Brackets with slotted holes

**2. First Prototypes**
- Test fit first
- Measure actual kerf
- Adjust for production run

**3. Using SheetMates Auto-Compensation**
- We handle kerf compensation automatically
- No manual adjustment needed
- Accurate results guaranteed

## How to Compensate in CAD

### Method 1: Offset Command (Recommended)

**Works in:** Fusion 360, SolidWorks, AutoCAD, LibreCAD

**Steps:**
1. Draw part at **nominal size** (your target dimensions)
2. Offset **internal features outward** by kerf/2
3. Offset **external boundaries inward** by kerf/2

**Why kerf/2?** The laser beam center follows your cut path. Half the beam removes material on each side.

**Fusion 360 Example:**
```
1. Sketch → Select internal hole
2. Modify → Offset → 0.1mm outward
3. Select external profile
4. Modify → Offset → 0.1mm inward
```

**AutoCAD Example:**
```
Command: OFFSET
Specify offset distance: 0.1
Select object: [click hole]
Specify side: [click inside]
```

### Method 2: Adjust Dimensions

**Quick math approach:**

**Internal holes:**
- Target diameter: 10mm
- Kerf: 0.2mm
- Design diameter: 9.8mm (10 - 0.2)

**External parts:**
- Target width: 50mm
- Kerf: 0.2mm
- Design width: 50.2mm (50 + 0.2)

**Cons:**
- Tedious for complex shapes
- Easy to miss features
- Hard to verify

## Kerf Width by Material

Different materials and thicknesses produce different kerf widths:

| Material | Thickness | Typical Kerf | Notes |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Steel** | 1mm | 0.15mm | Very consistent |
| **Steel** | 3mm | 0.20mm | Slight increase |
| **Steel** | 10mm | 0.25mm | Thicker = wider kerf |
| **Aluminum** | 2mm | 0.25mm | More reflective |
| **Aluminum** | 6mm | 0.35mm | Wider than steel |
| **Stainless** | 3mm | 0.20mm | Similar to steel |
| **Copper** | 3mm | 0.40mm | Highly reflective |

**Rule of thumb:** Thicker material = wider kerf

## Testing Your Kerf

Want to know the exact kerf for your setup?

**Test Piece Method:**

1. **Cut a square:**
   - Design: 100.00mm × 100.00mm
   - No compensation

2. **Measure result:**
   - Use digital calipers
   - Measure to 0.01mm precision
   - Result: 99.80mm × 99.80mm

3. **Calculate kerf:**
   - Kerf = Designed - Measured
   - Kerf = 100.00 - 99.80 = 0.20mm

4. **Cut a hole:**
   - Design: 20.00mm diameter
   - Measure result: 20.20mm
   - Kerf confirmed: 0.20mm

**Pro tip:** Test with your actual material and thickness.

## Common Kerf Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Over-Compensating

**Problem:** Applying kerf compensation twice

**How it happens:**
- Software applies compensation
- Laser machine also compensates
- Result: Double compensation

**Solution:**
- Check CAM software settings
- SheetMates handles this automatically

### Mistake #2: Wrong Direction

**Problem:** Offsetting the wrong way

**Internal holes:** Offset OUTWARD (make hole smaller in design)
**External parts:** Offset INWARD (make part bigger in design)

**Visual Check:**
- Internal features: Design should be **smaller** than target
- External features: Design should be **larger** than target

### Mistake #3: Forgetting Corners

**Problem:** Sharp corners lose material differently

**Solution:**
- Internal corners need **larger** radius after compensation
- External corners need **smaller** radius
- Test fit critical corners first

## Kerf Compensation Calculator

**Quick reference:**

**For a 10mm hole with 0.2mm kerf:**
- Without compensation: 10.2mm result
- With compensation: Design at 9.8mm → 10.0mm result

**For a 50mm part with 0.2mm kerf:**
- Without compensation: 49.8mm result
- With compensation: Design at 50.2mm → 50.0mm result

**General formula:**
```
Internal feature: DesignSize = TargetSize - Kerf
External feature: DesignSize = TargetSize + Kerf
```

## CAD Software Specific Tips

### Fusion 360

**Manufacturing Workspace:**
1. Create CAM setup
2. Set kerf compensation: 0.1mm (for 0.2mm kerf)
3. Direction: "Inside" for holes, "Outside" for external

### SolidWorks

**Sheet Metal:**
1. Tools → Options → Document Properties
2. Sheet Metal → Laser/Plasma
3. Kerf width: 0.2mm
4. Auto-applies to cut paths

### AutoCAD / LibreCAD

**Manual offset:**
1. Use OFFSET command
2. Specify distance: kerf/2
3. Manually select direction for each feature

## Real-World Example

**Scenario:** Mounting bracket with 4× M6 bolt holes

**Requirements:**
- M6 bolts: 6mm diameter
- Clearance fit: 6.5mm holes
- Tolerance: ±0.1mm
- Material: 3mm steel (kerf ~0.2mm)

**Without compensation:**
- Design: 6.5mm holes
- Result: 6.7mm holes (too loose)

**With compensation:**
- Design: 6.3mm holes (6.5 - 0.2)
- Result: 6.5mm holes ✓ Perfect fit

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I always compensate for kerf?**
A: No. For general fabrication with loose tolerances (±1mm), kerf doesn't matter. Compensate only when precision is critical.

**Q: Is kerf the same for all materials?**
A: No. Aluminum typically has wider kerf than steel. Copper even wider. Thicker materials also have wider kerf.

**Q: Can I use the same kerf value for all thicknesses?**
A: Not ideal. Kerf increases with thickness. Test each material/thickness combination for best results.

**Q: What if I don't know the kerf width?**
A: Cut a test piece and measure. Or use SheetMates—we know the kerf for each material/thickness combo.

**Q: Does kerf affect nesting?**
A: Yes, slightly. Parts with compensation are slightly different sizes, affecting how tightly they pack. SheetMates optimizes for this.

## Summary

**Kerf compensation in 3 rules:**

1. **Internal features:** Design smaller (reduce by kerf)
2. **External features:** Design larger (increase by kerf)
3. **Only compensate when precision matters** (±0.2mm or tighter)

**Using SheetMates?** Skip manual compensation—we handle it automatically for accurate results every time.
