          },

            "question": "How does it work?",
            "answer": "Upload your DXF files, and our system calculates the area and cut length. Your parts are nested with others on shared sheets. Once a sheet reaches 85% utilization, it goes to production. You pay only for your share of the material and cutting costs."

            "answer": "Pricing is based on two factors: material area (per cm²) and cut length (per mm). These base rates are multiplied by material type and thickness factors. You can see the exact formula on our Pricing page."
          },
          {
            "question": "Are there minimum order fees?",

          {
            "question": "What's included in the price?",

          },

            "question": "What thicknesses are available?",
            "answer": "We support thicknesses from 0.5mm to 20mm for steel, and 0.5mm to 25mm for aluminum. Thicker materials have higher multipliers due to slower cutting speeds."
          },
          {

            "answer": "Our sheets are 3000mm x 1500mm. Your parts must fit within these dimensions with margin for nesting. The system will warn you if a part is too large."

          },
          {
            "question": "What export settings should I use?",

            "question": "What are common mistakes to avoid?",

          {
            "question": "What's the viability threshold?",
            "answer": "Sheets go to production when they reach 85% utilization. This ensures efficient material usage. You can track sheet fill progress in real-time."

          {
            "question": "Can I expedite my order?",
